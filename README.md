# Energy-Efficient-Schedular
Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing an Energy-Efficient CPU Scheduling Algorithm aimed at reducing energy consumption in mobile and embedded systems. The algorithm optimizes CPU scheduling to minimize power usage without compromising system performance or responsiveness. It can be particularly useful for devices that operate on battery power, such as smartphones, tablets, wearables, and IoT devices, where power efficiency is crucial.

Key Objectives
Reduce Energy Consumption: The primary goal of this project is to design a scheduling algorithm that reduces the energy consumption of mobile and embedded systems.

Maintain Performance: The algorithm ensures that system performance, in terms of responsiveness and task execution, is not sacrificed.

Dynamic Power Adjustment: The scheduler dynamically adjusts the CPU’s power states based on the workload requirements to reduce unnecessary energy expenditure.

Compatibility: Designed to work with mobile and embedded systems, making it ideal for energy-constrained devices.

Algorithm Design
The core of this project is the energy-efficient CPU scheduling algorithm, which takes into account various factors such as:

CPU Power States: The CPU is capable of switching between different power states (e.g., idle, active, sleep modes) to save energy. The algorithm intelligently switches between these states depending on the workload.

Task Prioritization: Tasks are prioritized based on their urgency and resource requirements. Short, low-priority tasks might be batched together to optimize CPU usage and reduce energy spikes.

Task Execution Time Estimation: The scheduler estimates the execution time for each task and adjusts the CPU’s clock speed and power consumption accordingly.

Energy-Aware Scheduling: The algorithm uses energy consumption models to make informed scheduling decisions, ensuring tasks are executed in the most energy-efficient manner possible.

Features
Energy Efficiency: Reduces power usage by leveraging dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) and dynamic voltage scaling (DVS).

Scalable: The scheduling algorithm can be adapted for different levels of system complexity and power requirements.

Task Management: Efficient task management with varying priorities, ensuring high-priority tasks get executed promptly while optimizing energy use.

Cross-Platform: Designed with the flexibility to be integrated into mobile and embedded operating systems.
